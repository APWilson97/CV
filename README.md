# Alexander Wilson

I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently enrolled at Makers Academy in their Software Development Track, with four years of experience working in Japan in Customer Service, Recruitment and Translation as a bilingual professional. 

Being in a position to bring a positive effect to people on a wider scale through products and services I've contributed to is a personal career goal of mine. This is what excites me most about the tech industry as I believe that it will allow me to achieve this goal and the main reason why I started to learn coding.
